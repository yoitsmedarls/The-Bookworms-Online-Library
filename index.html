                                    affects life on Earth.

                                        The book fleshes out Wallace-Wells'
                                        original magazine piece in more detail,
                                        dovetailing into discussions surrounding
                                        various possibilities for Earth's future
                                        across a spectrum of predicted future
                                        temperature ranges. It argues that even
                                        with active intervention, the effects of
                                        climate change will have catastrophic
                                        impacts across multiple spheres: rising
                                        sea levels, extreme heat events, mass
                                        extinction, dormant disease outbreaks,
                                        fires, droughts, and increased
                                        geopolitical conflict, among others.
                                        While such changes are presented as
                                        already in motion, Wallace-Wells
                                        suggests that the future can still be
                                        salvaged with proper political and
                                        scientific willpower over the coming
                                        years.

                                        The book received praise for its
                                        scientific approach to describing the
                                        potential impacts of climate change. It
                                        has been both celebrated and criticized
                                        for its dramatic depictions of future
                                        life on Earth.

                                        "The Uninhabitable Earth", which he
                                        later expanded into the 2019 book The
                                        Uninhabitable Earth.

                                        David Wallace-Wells' work has appeared
                                        in New York magazine, where he is a
                                        deputy editor. He also writes for The

                                        The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. On
                                        July 17, 2019, Wallace-Wells appeared on
                                        an episode of The Doctor's Farmacy, a
                                        video produced by the functional

                                        Since 2017, Wallace-Wells has written
                                        extensively about climate change in New
                                        York magazine. He has said that he is
                                        optimistic about the earth's
                                        environmental future, but he remains
                                        cautious. He has said that no matter the
                                        degree of environmental damage, "it will
                                        always be the case that the next decade
                                        could contain more warming, and more
                                        suffering, or less warming and less
                                        suffering."

                                        His best known work is "The
                                        Uninhabitable Earth", an article
                                        published July 9, 2017 in New York
                                        magazine. The essay received mixed to
                                        negative criticism from scientists, but
                                        was considered an important and
                                        impactful work by many reviewers.

                                        He later turned the work into a

                                        Elizabeth Kolbert said in a book blurb
                                        that David Wallace-Wells argues that the
                                        impacts of climate change will be much
                                        graver than most people realize, and
                                        that he's right.

                                        It covers all three phases of his
                                        career: his early days working on
                                        cognitive biases, his work on prospect
                                        theory, and his later work on happiness.

                                        The central thesis is a dichotomy
                                        between two modes of thought: "System 1"
                                        is fast, instinctive and emotional;
                                        "System 2" is slower, more deliberative,
                                        and more logical. The book delineates
                                        cognitive biases associated with each
                                        type of thinking, starting with
                                        Kahneman's own research on loss
                                        aversion. From framing choices to
                                        people's tendency to replace a difficult
                                        question with one which is easy to
                                        answer, the book highlights several
                                        decades of academic research to suggest
                                        that people place too much confidence in
                                        human judgement.

                                        Daniel Kahneman is an Israeli-American
                                        psychologist and economist notable for
                                        his work on the psychology of judgment
                                        and decision-making, as well as
                                        behavioral economics, for which he was
                                        awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in
                                        Economic Sciences (shared with Vernon L.
                                        Smith). His empirical findings challenge
                                        the assumption of human rationality
                                        prevailing in modern economic theory.

                                        With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman
                                        established a cognitive basis for common
                                        human errors that arise from heuristics
                                        and biases (Kahneman and Tversky, 1973;
                                        Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky, 1982;
                                        Tversky and Kahneman, 1974), and
                                        developed prospect theory.

                                        In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy
                                        magazine in its list of top global
                                        thinkers. In the same year, his book
                                        Thinking, Fast and Slow, which
                                        summarizes much of his research, was
                                        published and became a best seller.

                                    Charles Duhiig wrote the book "The Power of
                                    Habit" to explain just how our habits
                                    control us in our daily lives. Charles had
                                    also explained the reason why habits are
                                    powerful, it is because they create
                                    neurological cravings.

                                        the object of study of astronomy and
                                        modern physics. He talks about basic
                                        concepts like space and time, basic
                                        building blocks that make up the
                                        Universe (such as quarks) and the
                                        fundamental forces that govern it (such
                                        as gravity). He writes about
                                        cosmological phenomena such as the Big
                                        Bang and black holes. He discusses two
                                        major theories, general relativity and
                                        quantum mechanics, that modern
                                        scientists use to describe the Universe.
                                        Finally, he talks about the search for a
                                        unifying theory that describes
                                        everything in the Universe in a coherent
                                        manner.

                                        Stephen William Hawking was an English
                                        theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and
                                        author who was director of research at
                                        the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at
                                        the University of Cambridge at the time

                                        Hawking's scientific works included a
                                        collaboration with Roger Penrose on
                                        gravitational singularity theorems in
                                        the framework of general relativity and
                                        the theoretical prediction that black
                                        holes emit radiation, often called
                                        Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first
                                        to set out a theory of cosmology
                                        explained by a union of the general
                                        theory of relativity and quantum
                                        mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter
                                        of the many-worlds interpretation of
                                        quantum mechanics.

                                        Hawking achieved commercial success with
                                        several works of popular science in
                                        which he discusses his theories and
                                        cosmology in general. His book A Brief
                                        History of Time appeared on the Sunday
                                        Times bestseller list for a
                                        record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a
                                        Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime
                                        member of the Pontifical Academy of
                                        Sciences, and a recipient of the
                                        Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
                                        highest civilian award in the United
                                        States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked
                                        number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100
                                        Greatest Britons.

                                        science book by Rachel Carson. The book
                                        was published on September 27, 1962,
                                        documenting the adverse environmental
                                        effects caused by the indiscriminate use
                                        of pesticides. Carson accused the
                                        chemical industry of spreading
                                        disinformation, and public officials of
                                        accepting the industry's marketing
                                        claims unquestioningly.

                                        Starting in the late 1950s, prior to the
                                        book's publication, Carson had focused
                                        her attention on environmental
                                        conservation, especially environmental
                                        problems that she believed were caused
                                        by synthetic pesticides. The result of
                                        her research was Silent Spring, which
                                        brought environmental concerns to the
                                        American public. The book was met with
                                        fierce opposition by chemical companies,
                                        but, owing to public opinion, it brought
                                        about numerous changes. It spurred a
                                        reversal in the United States' national
                                        pesticide policy, led to a nationwide
                                        ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and
                                        helped to inspire an environmental
                                        movement that led to the creation of the
                                        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

                                        Carson began her career as an aquatic
                                        biologist in the U.S. Bureau of
                                        Fisheries, and became a full-time nature
                                        writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised
                                        1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won
                                        her a U.S. National Book Award,
                                        recognition as a gifted writer, and
                                        financial security. Her next book, The

                                        version of her first book, Under the Sea

                                        trilogy explores the whole of ocean life
                                        from the shores to the depths.

                                        Late in the 1950s, Carson turned her
                                        attention to conservation, especially
                                        some problems that she believed were
                                        caused by synthetic pesticides. The
                                        result was the book Silent Spring
                                        (1962), which brought environmental
                                        concerns to an unprecedented share of

                                        Spring was met with fierce opposition by
                                        chemical companies, it spurred a
                                        reversal in national pesticide policy,
                                        which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and
                                        other pesticides.

                                        Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is
                                        a book by Yuval Noah Harari, first
                                        published in Hebrew in Israel in 2011
                                        based on a series of lectures Hariri
                                        taught at The Hebrew University of
                                        Jerusalem, and in English in 2014. The
                                        book surveys the history of humankind
                                        from the evolution of archaic human
                                        species in the Stone Age up to the
                                        twenty-first century, focusing on Homo
                                        sapiens. The account is situated within
                                        a framework provided by the natural
                                        sciences, particularly evolutionary

                                        The reception of the book has been
                                        mixed. Whereas the general public's
                                        reaction to the book has been positive,
                                        scholars with relevant subject matter
                                        expertise have been very critical of the
                                        book.

                                        Harari writes about the "cognitive
                                        revolution" occurring roughly 70,000
                                        years ago when Homo sapiens supplanted
                                        the rival Neanderthals, developed
                                        language skills and structured
                                        societies, and ascended as apex
                                        predators, aided by the agricultural
                                        revolution and accelerated by the
                                        scientific method, which have allowed
                                        humans to approach near mastery over
                                        their environment. His books also
                                        examine the possible consequences of a
                                        futuristic biotechnological world in
                                        which intelligent biological organisms
                                        are surpassed by their own creations; he
                                        has said " Homo sapiens as we know them
                                        will disappear in a century or so".

                                        history from the more traditional

                                        of country". Zinn portrays a side of
                                        American history that can largely be
                                        seen as the exploitation and
                                        manipulation of the majority by rigged

                                        A People's History has been assigned as
                                        reading in many high schools and
                                        colleges across the United States. It
                                        has also resulted in a change in the
                                        focus of historical work, which now
                                        includes stories that previously were
                                        ignored. The book was a runner-up in
                                        1980 for the National Book Award. It
                                        frequently has been revised, with the

                                        Howard Zinn was an American historian,
                                        playwright, and socialist thinker. He
                                        was chair of the history and social
                                        sciences department at Spelman College,
                                        and a political science professor at
                                        Boston University. Zinn wrote over 20
                                        books, including his best-selling and
                                        influential A People's History of the
                                        United States. In 2007, he published a
                                        version of it for younger readers, A
                                        Young People's History of the United
                                        States.

                                    <p>
                                        Zinn described himself as "something of
                                        an anarchist, something of a socialist.
                                        Maybe a democratic socialist."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He wrote extensively about the Civil
                                        Rights Movement, the anti-war movement
                                        and labor history of the United States.
                                        His memoir, You Can't Be Neutral on a
                                        Moving Train (Beacon Press, 2002), was
                                        also the title of a 2004 documentary
                                        about Zinn's life and work. Zinn died of
                                        a heart attack in 2010, at age 87.

                                    The Bookworms: Library Assistant&trade;,
                                    provides a digital platform where you can
                                    view book information, and even allows you
                                    to borrow the book for some time. You just
                                    need to type in your name and ID number to
                                    complete the transaction. After that, you
                                    can now get your borrowed books from our
                                    library!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Your can access your books in the My Account
                                    section at the start screen. Once you create
                                    your account here, the system will
                                    automatically dedicate a page for you where
                                    you can see the books you borrowed. You can
                                    also return books through this assistant.
                                    Just select the book you want to return and
                                    choose to return the book. Then you can just
                                    stop over our library to return the book, no
                                    more forms and queries needed.
                                </p>

                                    Borrowed books can be used for upto three
                                    (3) months after you borrowed them. The
                                    borrow period is extended by borrowing more
                                    books. Borrowing three books for example
                                    allows you to borrow those books for three
                                    months. After that period, the assistant
                                    will constantly prompt you to return the
                                    books to our nearest library. Late returns
                                    have an payment of 20Php per day and must be
                                    payed upon returning the book.

                                    This Assistant is your personal assistant,
                                    which means it can only support one account.
                                    If you wish to create a new account, you
                                    will have to delete your current account in
                                    the My Account page. Deleting accounts are
                                    only possible if all the borrowed books have
                                    been returned.
